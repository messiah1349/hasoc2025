The bottom part shows a similar setting with the same two men, one drinking from a glass. The Bengali text in this part references the situation in 1990, stating that a constitution, government, army, and police existed, yet thousands of Hindu Kashmiri Pandits were killed and raped. The text then questions why they were forced to leave their country.","Look, Byomkesh Babu, you are telling us about the victory of Hindus in the history of 1946-1947.

","Gajinagar: For the past year, there has been a love affair between the eighth-grade student and the teacher. The young teacher was patient with the studies in the educational institution. But the girlfriend could not withstand the situation. The family and the school could not prevent it, so she eloped with her 'boyfriend' of 18 years, the teacher of 23 years. The incident took place in Gujarat's Gajinagar. The school teacher has lodged an FIR against the missing student's father in Gajinagar police station. The student's father informed in the FIR that her 18-year-old son had eloped with the teacher.",image_ben_5258.jpg

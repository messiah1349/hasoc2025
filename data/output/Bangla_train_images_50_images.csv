The humor is based on the ironic juxtaposition of the ancient, unclothed figures of Adam and Eve with modern clothing.

The son's reply, ""You only saw the young age, mom... you didn't see the other 'big' things...!"", is highly sarcastic and uses a vulgar innuendo to refer to physical attributes. The overall sentiment is negative as it highlights and makes light of a socially contentious topic (age-gap marriage) with suggestive humor, targeting the individuals involved.",image_ben_3869.jpg
Negative,True,True,True,individual,"The meme uses a fake news format to portray a fabricated and vulgar scenario where a politician, Debangshu, faints after seeing the private parts of an actress, Srabanti, presented as 'breaking news'.

Neutral,True,False,False,gender,"The meme shows a woman asking a doctor, ""Why didn't you deliver the baby from the womb?"" The doctor replies, ""Because it was a boy, and I don't deliver boys (who are 'sighted'/sharp).""

The joke derives its humor from the doctor's nonsensical prejudice, subtly touching on societal perceptions or preferences related to gender through satire.",image_ben_4684.jpg
Negative,True,True,True,individual,"The Bengali text ""চাটতে থাকুন"" (Chatte thakun) translates to ""Keep licking"" or ""Continue licking."" In this context, it is a vulgar and derogatory phrase often used sarcastically to imply that someone is being sycophantic, fawning, or excessively subservient.

Negative,False,False,False,non-targeted,"The meme shows a young boy holding a baby whose mouth is on the boy's finger. Below, Bengali text reads ""After seeing this, I..."" next to a 'puke' rage face. The meme expresses a strong feeling of disgust or aversion towards the depicted scene, likely due to the perceived unhygienic nature of the baby's action. It is not targeted at any specific group or individual in an abusive way, but rather a reaction to a general observation.",image_ben_7399.jpg
Negative,True,False,True,individual,"The meme shows a woman with an exasperated expression. The top text in Bengali reads ""আপনি শুধু মুখ চালান বিমান দা"" (You just keep running your mouth, Biman Da), a dismissive and critical statement directed at an individual. The bottom text reads ""গুগল পে এখন সব জায়গায় চলে"" (Google Pay works everywhere now), which serves as a sarcastic contrast to highlight the perceived uselessness or outdatedness of the person being criticized.

Below, Yogi Adityanath is shown with text in Bengali: ""I once went to Babri Masjid, since then no one is allowing [anyone] to go."" The meme is highly sarcastic, ridiculing Priyanka Gandhi's initial statement and using Yogi Adityanath's implied response to sarcastically allude to the controversial demolition of the Babri Masjid, suggesting that after his alleged involvement, the mosque no longer exists for anyone to visit.

Negative,True,False,False,individual,"The meme features a humorous conversation between MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli. Dhoni says Virat shouldn't take anything ""useless"" from England. Kohli replies he hasn't. Dhoni then jokes that he brought Suresh Raina (implying Raina is useless), which makes Kohli burst into laughter, confirming Dhoni's statement that what he said (about Raina) is ""completely useless"". The sentiment is negative towards Suresh Raina, calling him ""useless"", but it's presented in a sarcastic and humorous way rather than genuinely abusive.",image_ben_7428.jpg
Negative,False,False,True,religion,"The meme uses a fabricated or misleading news headline about Taimur Ali Khan (a Muslim child) wanting to rob banks and generalizes this as ""Muslims' childhood wishes"". It then juxtaposes this with an image of a young man and a caption implying that this (presumably criminal activity) is how one achieves success. This creates a derogatory stereotype linking a religious community (Muslims) to criminal behavior and implies that this is their typical path to success, which constitutes abuse against the religious group.",image_ben_478.png
Neutral,True,False,False,non-targeted,"The meme displays a dog with an angry expression, accompanied by text in Bengali that translates to: 'Showing anger at mother because she forgot to fill water in the tank in the morning, so I have to go out without bathing.'

This is juxtaposed with a surprised image of Johnny Sins and Bengali text asking 'Only want to sleep?'.

The text praises Modi's leadership, using the phrase ""56 inches"" power, a common reference to him, and states he achieved what others could not in 70 years.

The use of a strong expletive makes it vulgar and abusive. The sentiment is negative due to the derogatory language, and the 'sorry' makes it sarcastic. The target is an unspecified group of individuals.",image_ben_861.png
Neutral,True,False,False,non-targeted,"The meme humorously exaggerates the impact of Mountain Dew's launch in India. It implies that before 2003, Indians were 'scared' (as depicted by the distressed character and Bengali text 'I am feeling somewhat scared'), satirically linking the drink to courage, referencing its popular slogan. The humor is based on irony and exaggeration rather than malice.",image_ben_2222.png

This is a sarcastic commentary on the dramatic or frustrating elements often found in such serials. The sentiment is negative as it conveys annoyance or disdain for the serial's content/tropes.

The final panel shows the man garlanded, sarcastically 'honoring' his dedication to sports. The sentiment is negative because the girl is clearly frustrated and annoyed.

Narendra Modi's counter-quote states, ""If even half of what has been given, your 'development army' had given to the people instead of consuming it themselves, then the change would have come in reality, not just on paper."" The sentiment is negative because it criticizes the state government for alleged mismanagement and misappropriation of funds, implying that they are responsible for the lack of real development.

The target is political, specifically criticizing the ruling party in West Bengal.",image_ben_120.png
Negative,True,False,False,political,"The meme depicts a distressed farmer sitting next to his burning field, while a goat tells him, ""For God's sake, don't ruin the country's reputation, miya.""

Negative,False,True,True,gender,"The meme displays images of sliced fruits (sapodilla/chikoo) that visually resemble female genitalia, juxtaposed with text in Bengali that translates to ""Water that has come into contact with this virus can also spread this virus.""

Neutral,True,False,False,non-targeted,"The meme uses a humorous and sarcastic tone to exaggerate the feeling of self-importance after performing a very small act of generosity, like lending a trivial amount of money.

Negative,True,False,False,political,"The image features caricatures of prominent Indian political leaders, including Narendra Modi, Amit Shah, Rahul Gandhi, and Mamata Banerjee, arranged in a 'house of cards' structure.

It is sarcastic because it uses a shocking and offensive exaggeration to emphasize the speaker's desire to avoid batting. While vulgar, it is not directed at any specific person or group with abusive intent, but rather expresses a general, albeit crude, sentiment of avoiding an undesirable task, making it non-targeted.",image_ben_4337.jpg
Negative,True,False,True,social subgroups,"The meme criticizes a specific group of people, identified as those who participated in CAA protests and allegedly caused property damage due to 'hurt religious sentiments'.

It uses sarcasm by juxtaposing SFI's slogan 'JOIN SFI BE A COMPLETE MAN' with an image of a person wearing a bra, implying that joining SFI leads to a loss of traditional masculinity.
